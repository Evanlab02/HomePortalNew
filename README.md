# Home Portal

NOTE: Home portal is still in early development. Please keep an eye here for updates as this documentation is still very much under construction.

Home portal is a collection of tools, services and applications. Using docker it integrates all the services and applications in a single place and with the help of caddy (reverse proxy) we can access all the services and applications using a single domain.
